## Core Functionality
The control plane is the central nervous system for your SaaS platform. Its primary role is to act as the automated administrator for all tenant instances.
Tenant Provisioning: Programmatically create a full, dedicated infrastructure stack for a new tenant on Render using a render.yaml blueprint as a template.
Configuration Management: Dynamically inject customer-specific configurations (like service names and domains) into the deployment blueprint before sending it to the Render API.
Tenant De-provisioning: Securely and completely remove all of a tenant's services from Render when they cancel their subscription.
## Customer & Tenant Management
This set of requirements focuses on tracking and managing the state of each customer and their associated cloud resources.
Service ID Mapping: Store and maintain a mapping in its own database that links each customer to the unique service IDs of their deployed resources on Render (web service, database, etc.).
Plugin & Customization Management: Store a record of which custom code plugins belong to which customer. This information will be used to modify the build process for that specific tenant.
Cost Allocation: Use the stored service IDs to query the Render API and calculate the precise infrastructure cost for each individual tenant.
## Operational & Business Logic
These are the features that connect the core technical functions to your business operations.
User Interface/API: Provide an interface (whether it's an internal dashboard or an API) for your team to manage tenants.
Onboarding Trigger: Expose an endpoint that can be triggered by your public-facing website when a new customer signs up, initiating the tenant provisioning process.
Lifecycle Management: Handle the entire customer lifecycle, including upgrades, downgrades (which might involve changing instance types via the Render API), and service suspension.
